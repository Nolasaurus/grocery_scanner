# Grocery Value Scanner App

## Startup Instructions

## v0.1

- Android Phone App cuz that’s all I have to test with
- like CamelCamelCamel but for groceries

## Features

### MVP

- In-app camera to scan barcode, labels
- App OCRs nutrition facts and ingredients
- Customer enters price to get protein, fat, cal per dollar
- Calculate other useful metrics (e.g. % calories from sugar, macros)

### Wishlist

- Save data, image to local db (sqlite?), then upload optimized image
- Compare 2+ products at once, locally i.e. scan prod1, then prod2, then prod3
- Scan History

### Far Future

- Compare current scan to previous user scans (price change, macro ratio change, net weight change, $ / macro price change)App run
- Compare current scan to other recent, nearby scans (2/5/10/20/50 mile radius)
- Monetization (affiliate links?)
