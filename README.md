# Grocery Value Scanner App
# v0.1
- Android Phone App cuz thatâ€™s all I have to test with
- like CamelCamelCamel but for groceries
## Features
### MVP
* In-app camera to scan barcode, labels
* App OCRs nutrition facts and ingredients
* Customer enters price to get protein, fat, cal per dollar
* Calculate other useful metrics (e.g. % calories from sugar, macros)

### Wishlist
* Save data, image to db
* Compare 2+ products at once, locally i.e. scan prod1, then prod2, then prod3
* Compare current scan to previous user scans (price change, macro ratio change, net weight change, $ / macro price change)
* Compare current scan to other recent, nearby scans (2/5/10/20/50 mile radius)
* Monetization (affiliate links?)
